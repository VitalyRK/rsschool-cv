## About me
Hi there! I’m frontend developer from Gomel Belarus. I have no work experience as a developer yet. But i’ve been studing and impruving my skills for almost half a year. I finished a couple of small online courses of Web Development and have a several projects in my portfolio written in HTML + CSS, a little JS. I have a lot of plans and dreams, and of course the main dream is to improve my technical skills and become a professional developer. And then, i'd like to create inviting, easy-to-use websites for consumers.

## Skills
* HTML
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Basic, DOM, JSON)
* Figma
* Photoshop (Basic)
* Git

## Code Example
Define a function that takes an integer argument and returns a logical value true or false depending on if the integer is a prime.
```
    function isPrime(num) {
        for(let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if(num % i === 0) {
            return false;
            }
        }
    return num > 1
    }
```

## Experience
In 2009-2022, worked generally in another field - retail trade. Owned some mini shops, but in 2022 I closed my business and I started to be interested in front-end development.
