## About me
Hi there! I’m frontend developer from Gomel Belarus. I have no work experience as a developer yet. But i’ve been studing and impruving my skills for almost half a year. I finished a couple of small online courses of Web Development and have a several projects in my portfolio written in HTML + CSS, a little JS. I have a lot of plans and dreams, and of course the main dream is to improve my technical skills and become a professional developer. And then, i'd like to create inviting, easy-to-use websites for consumers.
